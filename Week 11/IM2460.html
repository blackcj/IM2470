Slides must contain a combination of media (no all image slideshows) including text, images and HTML5 media elements (video and/or audio content). Navigation should be in place to move from slide to slide, or to a specific slide within the presentation. Use CSS3 transitions to animate between slides using x,y,z axis, scaling, and opacity.</p>
